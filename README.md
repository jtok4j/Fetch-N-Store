<STRONG>In-App Live Data/Variable/Resource replacement</STRONG>
<P>

These set of tools allow for development of an app/game/software which can retrieve replacement
values(variables)/images/audio/video for your project after it’s been deployed, without requiring a downloaded update to the app
version from the App Store/Repository.
<P><BR>

<STRONG>CASE USES:<P></STRONG>

<STRONG>Image Replacement (Example Uses)</STRONG>
- A news ad/banner/pic of your own with an updated version
- A logo in-game with a new/modified logo.
- An texture in-game with a new texture than what was shipped out with the original build.
<P><BR>

<STRONG>Video Replacement:(Example Uses)</STRONG>
- An updated promo video for your other apps, or replace initial cut-scene videos with edited ones.
<P>
Variable/Values Replacement:(Example Uses)
From: (string) “ 2392199” to (string: read from online text file) “1939327"
<P>
Anything that uses a variable, such as:
- a string variable for your Unity Ads/Advertisement provider's specific ID for your account? Can be changed on the fly this way,
should you need to change it.
- variables for character stats or to tweak in-game stats/difficulty levels/settings.
- change default settings in-game after the app is live, without requiring a downloaded update from the app store.
<P><BR><STRONG>
Audio Replacement:(Example Uses)</STRONG>
<P>
- Change sound-tracks or add more audio clips.
- Change audio effects
- Add a greeting to your app, upon launch or In-game voice message updates
<P>
<EM><STRONG>How does this work? </EM></STRONG>
The method used is to check upon app startup, the values/resources in the app, which you specified to be updated, should there be a
newer/different version hosted online in your online web resource, such as the files on your website. <EM><BR>
(requires the app have internet
access and these features added during development time within the Unity Editor)</EM>
